# NexiClicker Remaster 

NexiClicker Remaster is an app that allows user to automatically click a button on their keyboard or mouse in a specific period of time delay.
It is currently the best free program of this type, with a wide range of applications and significantly exceeds users' expectations.
Nexi Clicker is strongly intended for users playing computer games, but it's worth mentioning that some of them view Autoclicker as unfair advantage.
The author is not responsible for the purpose for which the program is used, the users use it at their own discretion.
