# NexiClicker Remaster 

NexiClicker Remaster is an app that allows user to automatically click a button on their keyboard or mouse in a specific period of time delay.
It is currently the best free program of this typ and it significantly exceeds users' expectations.
Nexi Clicker is intended for users playing computer games, but it's worth mentioning that some of them view Autoclicker as _unfair advantage_. The author does not support cheating in games and promotes the use of this application where it is allowed
The author is not responsible for the purpose for which the program is used, the users use it at their own discretion.

## Installation

It is reccomened to have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer) installed before.

## Setting up an AutoClicker

Here you can adjust the settings of the autoclicker:
- **HOTKEY** - Click the button with LMB and press the key that you want to be automatically clicked by a program.
- **BIND** - Click the button with LMB and press the key that you want to bind the autoclicker. When it is pressed, the robot that clicks the hotkey will run.
- **CPS** - Adjust the value of Clicks Per Second using this slider.
- **START** - Enable listening for the bind that you've set. After pressing this you will be able to stop the process. This will not work if you did not adjust previous settings.


## Running the AutoClicker

This is an example of correctly set up autoclicker. 

When you click the Start button, the app listens for keyboard and mouse movement to detect whether you've pressed the bind for your clicker. If you press it, the program will start the robot, which will press the hotkey for you at the appropriate interval that you set with the CPS slider. 
To stop this process, click the bind again, then the program will kill the robot and no longer press the hotkey.
This works everywhere, regardless of what else you do on your computer. If you click the stop button, the app will stop listening to your keyboard and mouse.

## Tool bar

- **SAVE** - saves your autoclicker setup. The configuration loads as you launch NexiClicker. 
- **LOAD** - loads your currently saved setup.
- **RESET** - resets _both_ saved configuration and current configuration.
- **EXIT** - exit the app 

## Fullscreen Overlay

When you press the button below the tool bar, you con watch the settings and status of your autoclickers on the fullscreen app! 
It's an transparent window that appears on the left corner of your monitor everytime you launch other application on fullscreen mode. It is not focusable and you cannot change the position of it. 
> NOTE: This feature is very limited as some applications do not allow any other processes on top for security reasons. If the overlay does not appear, the application that is on fullscreen mode does not allow this. 
Sometimes changing the resolution from fullscreen to windowed fullscreen will solve the problem.
